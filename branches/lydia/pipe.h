/**
   This class defines the implementation of the FIFO (first in, first out)
   buffered threadsafe pipe. This component is massively used in MuSE's
   flow of audio data, connecting the Channel to the Stream_mixer and then
   to the OutChannel.
   
   This Pipe implementation is fairly well tested and optimized, usesu
   pthread mutexes for fast atomical locking and has a mixing routine
   embedded for for reading data from the pipe.

   When an application locks the Pipe, will be waiting until it reaches
   to gain the lock, then will  (pthread_mutex_lock)

   This pipe is never blocking, meaning that it never makes the calling
   process wait for result. The Pipe::blocking attribute of this class
   has to be intended in a different way.

   Blocking means that the Pipe::read, Pipe::write and derivative
   functions will be returning -1 without moving any data, in case
   the aumount of data requested don't fit for pipe buffers.
   
   Non-blocking means that the Pipe::read, Pipe::write and derivative
   functions will move all the data they can move, even if less than
   requested, and then return the amount of data moved.

   I know, the above might sound weird, just because i used the word
   'blocking' where i shouldn't. i beg your pardon and plan to change
   it in future.
