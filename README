IvySync provides synced playback of multiple videos on multiple screens

In the video art field there are many artworks requiring the synced and
parallel  playback  of  audio/video  materials:  IvySync  provides such
functionality  for  IvyTV  supported  hardware  decoders, with accurate
frame precision. 

IvySync reaches to sync up to 4 video channels with frame precision and
comes together with a user friendly graphical interface (GTK2) to  edit
the playlists.

With version 0.3 is now possible to remotely control the playback and
skip positions on videos sending commands across the network (XMLRPC).
Support for time based scheduling of different playlists is also
implemented (but still lacking a graphical interface) to let a running
syncstarter cycle various screening programs at different hours, days
or months.


IvySync has been employed by Montevideo / Time Based Arts to produce and
exhibit video-art installations by, among the others:
Linda Wallace, Calin Dan, Erwin Olaf, Sami Kallinen
