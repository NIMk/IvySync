IvySync provides synced playback of multiple videos on multiple screens

In the video art field there are many artworks requiring the synced and
parallel  playback  of  audio/video  materials:  IvySync  provides such
functionality  for  IvyTV  supported  hardware  decoders, with accurate
frame precision. 

IvySync reaches to sync up to 4 video channels with frame precision and
comes together with a user friendly graphical interface (GTK2) to  edit
the playlists.

It is possible to remotely control the playlist and  playback  of  each
video sending commands across the network (XMLRPC).
Support for time  based  scheduling  of  different  playlists  is  also
implemented (but still lacking a graphical interface) to let a  running
syncstarter cycle various screening programs at different  hours,  days
or months.


IvySync is a dyne.org free software production (GNU GPL)
commissioned by Montevideo / Time Based Arts
used to exhibit video-art installations by, among the  others:
Linda Wallace, Calin Dan, Erwin Olaf, Sami Kallinen
